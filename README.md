# TLS-SSL-Comm

The purpose of this project is to deepen your understanding of cryptographic primitives
used in SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) and to gain practical
experience in implementing a secure communication protocol. We will be designing and implementing a simplified version of SSL/TLS, focusing on key cryptographic
components such as AES, SHA256, Diffie-Hellman, RSA, and PKI.
